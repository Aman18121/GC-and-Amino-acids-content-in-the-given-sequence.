GC Content Summary

GC content refers to the proportion of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) bases in a DNA or RNA molecule. It is a crucial measure in molecular biology because G and C bases form three hydrogen bonds,
which make the DNA or RNA strand more stable compared to adenine (A) and thymine (T) bases that form only two hydrogen bonds. High GC content regions are more thermally stable and can influence the structural and 
functional properties of the genome, including the melting temperature of DNA, gene density, and the ease of genomic sequencing and analysis.

This Python project is designed to perform the following tasks:

GC Content Percentage Calculation:

Functionality: Calculates the percentage of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) bases in a given DNA or RNA sequence.
Usage: Helps in determining the stability and melting temperature of the sequence.
Amino Acid Content Calculation:

Functionality: Calculates the frequency and percentage of each amino acid in a given protein sequence.
Usage: Useful for analyzing protein composition and properties.
Sequence Comparison:

Functionality: Compares two sequences to find matches and mismatches, and calculates the similarity score.
Usage: Useful in identifying homologous regions, mutations, and evolutionary relationships between sequences.
GC Content Comparison:

Functionality: Compares the GC content of two sequences to identify differences in stability and potential functional implications.
Usage: Useful in comparative genomics and evolutionary studies.
